# NBA-Next-Basket
DraftKings offers a live bet during the NBA playoffs on whether the next made basket will be a 2 or a 3 pointer. I didn't believe 3's occurred so randomly so I investigated.


# The histogram.py file is used to visualize the occurences of 3-pointers relative to other 3-pointers and is the foundation of this project
# The money3s_1shot.py file is used to back test the betting strategy
# The NextBasket.docx file is the description of entire project from an introduction, to research conclusions, to future improvements.
